Description: This paper attempts to present the underlined ideology of the Open Government
  Data and Right To Information movements, which have fashioned the access to government
  information and to substantiate that the way to the future is a one-way street towards
  the greatest possible dissemination of government information as this can be established
  by the synergy of RTI and OGD in order to preserve and promote the primary human
  and political right to receive information so as to be informed and able to freely
  express opinions, ideas and thoughts.
