title: The Open Data Handbook
---

**This handbook discusses the legal, social and technical aspects of open data.** It can be used by anyone but is especially designed for those seeking to **open up** data. It discusses the **why, what and how** of open data -- why to go open, what open is, and the how to 'open' data.

To get started, you may wish to look at the [Introduction](introduction/). You can navigate through the report using the Table of Contents (see sidebar or below).

We warmly welcome comments on the text and will incorporate feedback as we go forward. We also welcome contributions or suggestions for additional sections and areas to examine.
