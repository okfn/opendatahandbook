# Glossary

  Open Data
    Open data are able to be used for any purpose. More details can be
    read at `opendefinition.org <http://www.opendefinition.org/>`_.

  Machine-readable
    Formats that are machine readable are ones which are
    able to have their data extracted by computer programs easily. PDF
    documents are not machine readable. Computers can display the text
    nicely, but have great difficulty understanding the context that
    surrounds the text.

  Connectivity
    Connectivity relates to the ability for communities to connect to
    the Internet, especially the World Wide Web.

  BitTorrent
    BitTorrent is a protocol for distributing the bandwith for
    transferring very large files between the computers which are
    participating in the transfer. Rather than downloading a file
    from a specific source, BitTorrent allows peers to download
    from each other.

  DAP
    See :term:`Data Access Protocol`.

  Data Access Protocol
    A system that allows outsiders to be granted access to databases
    without overloading either system.

  Attribution License
    A license that requires that the original source
    of the licensed material is cited (attributed).

  Data protection legislation
    Data protection legislation is not about protecting the data,
    but about protecting the right of citizens to live without fear
    that information about their private lives might become public.
    The law protects privacy (such as information about a person's
    economic status, health and political position) and other rights
    such as the right to freedom of movement and assembly. For example,
    in Finland a travel card system was used to record all instances when the
    card was shown to the reader machine on different public transport
    lines. This raised a debate from the perspective of freedom of
    movement and the travel card data collection was abandoned based
    on the data protection legislation.

  PSI
    See :term:`Public Sector Information`.

  Public Sector Information
    Information collected or controlled by the public sector.

  API
    See :term:`Application Programming Interface`.

  Application Programming Interface
    A way computer programs talk to one another. Can be understood
    in terms of how a programmer sends instructions between programs.

  Web API
    An :term:`API` that is designed to work over the Internet.

  Share-alike License
    A license that requires users of a work to provide the content
    under the same or similar conditions as the original.

  Public domain
    No copyright exists over the work. Does not exist in all
    jurisdictions.

  Database rights
    A right to prevent others from extracting and reusing content from
    a database. Exists mainly in European jurisdictions.

  Copyright
    A right for the creators of creative works to restrict others' use
    of those works. An owner of copyright is entitled to determine how
    others may use that work.

  Re-use
    Use of content outside of its original intention.

  Open standards
    Generally understood as technical standards which are free from
    licencing restrictions. Can also be interpreted to mean standards
    which are developed in a vendor-neutral manner.

  Anonymization
   See :term:`Anonymisation`.

  Anonymisation
    The process of adapting data so that individuals cannot be identified from it.

  IP rights
    See :term:`Intellectual property rights`.

  Intellectual property rights
    Monopolies granted to individuals for intellectual creations.

  AR

  EU
    European Union.

  EU PSI Directive
    The *Directive on the re-use of public sector information*,
    2003/98/EC. "deals with the way public sector bodies should
    enhance re-use of their information resources."
    `Legislative Actions - PSI Directive <http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/psi/actions_eu/policy_actions/index_en.htm>`_

  Information Asset Register
    IARs are registers specifically set up to capture and organise
    meta-data about the vast quantities of information held by
    government departments and agencies. A comprehensive IAR includes
    databases, old sets of files, recent electronic files, collections
    of statistics, research and so forth.

    The :term:`EU PSI Directive` recognises the importance of asset
    registers for prospective re-users of public information. It
    requires member states to provide lists, portals, or something
    similar. It states::

       Tools that help potential re-users to find documents available
       for re-use and the conditions for re-use can facilitate
       considerably the cross-border use of public sector documents.
       Member States should therefore ensure that practical arrangements
       are in place that help re-users in their search for documents
       available for reuse. Assets lists, accessible preferably online,
       of main documents (documents that are extensively re-used or
       that have the potential to be extensively re-used), and portal
       sites that are linked to decentralised assets lists are examples
       of such practical arrangements.

    IARs can be developed in different ways. Government departments
    can develop their own IARs and these can be linked to national
    IARs. IARs can include information which is held by public bodies
    but which has not yet been – and maybe will not be – proactively
    published. Hence they allow members of the public to identify
    information which exists and which can be requested.

    For the public to make use of these IARs, it is important that any
    registers of information held should be as complete as possible in order
    to be able to have confidence that documents can be found. The
    incompleteness of some registers is a significant problem as
    it creates a degree of unreliability which may discourage some from
    using the registers to search for information.

    It is essential that the metadata in the IARs should be comprehensive so
    that search engines can function effectively. In the spirit of
    open government data, public bodies should make their IARs
    available to the general public as raw data under an open license so
    that civic hackers can make use of the data, for example by building
    search engines and user interfaces.

  Open Government Data
    :term:`Open data` produced by the government. This is generally
    accepted to be data gathered during the course of business as usual
    activities which do not identify individuals or breach commercial
    sensitivity. Open government data is a subset of :term:`Public
    Sector Information`, which is broader in scope.
    See http://opengovernmentdata.org for details.

  Tab-separated values
    Tab-separated values (TSV) are a very common form of text file
    format for sharing tabular data. The format is extremely simple
    and highly :term:`machine-readable`.
