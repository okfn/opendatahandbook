title: Scraping
---

Extracting data from a non-{machine-readable} source, such as a website or a [PDF](/glossary/en/terms/pdf/) document, and creating {structured data} from the result. Screen-scraping a dataset requires dedicated programming and is expensive in programmer time, so is generally done only after all other attempts to get the data in structured form have failed. Legal questions may arise about whether the scraping breaches the source website's [copyright](/glossary/en/terms/copyright/) or terms of service.
