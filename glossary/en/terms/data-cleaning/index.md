Processing a dataset to make it easier to consume. This may involve fixing inconsistencies and errors, removing non-machine-readable elements such as formatting, using standard labels for row and column headings, ensuring that numbers, dates, and other quantities are represented appropriately, [conversion](/glossary/en/terms/conversion/) to a suitable [file format](/glossary/en/terms/file-format/), reconciliation of labels with another dataset being used (see [data integration](/glossary/en/terms/data-integration/)), etc. See [data quality](/glossary/en/terms/data-quality/).
