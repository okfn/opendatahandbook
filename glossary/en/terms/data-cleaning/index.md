Processing a dataset to make it easier to consume. This may involve fixing inconsistencies and errors, removing non-{machine-readable} elements such as formatting, using standard labels for row and column headings, ensuring that numbers, dates, and other quantities are represented appropriately, {conversion} to a suitable {file format}, reconciliation of labels with another dataset being used (see {data integration}), etc. See {data quality}.
