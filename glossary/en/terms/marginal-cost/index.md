title: Marginal cost
---

The additional cost incurred by supplying a single copy of a resource, e.g. data. For data to be open according to the [Open Definition](/glossary/en/terms/open-definition/), it must be charged for at no more than marginal cost. Where data is available for download over the internet the marginal cost will usually be zero. There may be a small marginal cost in exceptional cases, e.g. if for reasons of size the data needs to be put on a disk and posted. Compare {cost-recovery}.
