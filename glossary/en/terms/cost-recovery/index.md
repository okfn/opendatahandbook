title: Cost recovery
---

The principle of setting a price for a resource, e.g. data, aiming to recover the cost of collecting the data, as distinct from [marginal cost](/glossary/en/terms/marginal-cost/). Data charged for on a cost-recovery basis is not open data according to the [Open Definition](/glossary/en/terms/open-definition/). Studies show that charging for PSI on a cost-recovery basis leads to lower growth than free or marginal-cost pricing
