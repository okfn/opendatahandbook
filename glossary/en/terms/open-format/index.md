title: Open format
---

A [file format](/glossary/en/terms/file-format/) with no restrictions, monetary or otherwise, placed upon its use and can be fully processed with at least one free/libre/open-source software tool. Patents are a common source of restrictions that make a format [proprietary](/glossary/en/terms/proprietary/). Often, but not necessarily, the structure of an open format is set out in agreed [standards](/glossary/en/terms/standard), overseen and published by a non-commercial expert body. A file in an open format enjoys the guarantee that it can be correctly read by a range of different software programs or used to pass information between them.
