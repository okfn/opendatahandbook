title: Hackathon
---

An event, usually over one or two days, where developers, subject experts and others come together to create [apps](/glossary/en/terms/app-application), [visualisations](/glossary/en/terms/visualisation) and prototypes that aim to address problems in a particular domain, usually making heavy use of data. Hackathons focusing on a particular collection of data are a possible form of community engagement by data publishers. The hackathon is a popular format in the [open source](/glossary/en/terms/open-source/) community.
