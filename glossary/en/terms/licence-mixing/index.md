title: Licence mixing

If Project X publishes content, and wants to include content from Project Y, it is necessary that Y's [licence](/glossary/en/terms/licence/) permits at least the same range of {re-uses} as X's licence. For example, content published under a {non-commercial} licence cannot be included in Wikipedia, since Wikipedia's {open licence} includes rights for commercial re-use which cannot be granted for the non-commercial data, an example of a failure of licences to mix well.
