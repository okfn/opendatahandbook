title: Bulk 
---
The entirety of a dataset. Data is available in bulk if the entire dataset can be downloaded for further processing on the user's hardware. Bulk downloads should almost always be offered for open data, but may be impractical in the case of [big data](/glossary/en/terms/big-data/) or real-time data.
