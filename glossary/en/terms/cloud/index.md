Data stored 'in the cloud' is handled by a [hosting](/glossary/en/terms/host) company, relieving the data owner of the need to manage its physical storage. Instead of being stored on a single machine, it may be stored across or moved between multiple machines in different locations, but the data owner and users do not need to know the details. The hosting company is responsible for keeping it available and accessible via the [internet](/glossary/en/terms/internet/).
