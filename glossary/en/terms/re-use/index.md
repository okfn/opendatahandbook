It is rare that data gathered for a particular purpose does not have other possible uses. Happily, data is an infinite resource (see [tragedy of the anti-commons](/glossary/en/terms/tragedy-of-the-anti-commons/)); once gathered, for whatever reason, it can be re-used again and again, in ways that were never envisaged when it was collected, provided only that the data-holder makes it available under an {open licence} to enable such re-use.
