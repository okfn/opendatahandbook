Resource Description Framework, the native way of describing [linked data](/glossary/en/terms/linked-data/). RDF is not exactly a data format; rather, there are a few equivalent formats in which RDF can be expressed, including an [XML](/glossary/en/terms/xml/)-based format. RDF data takes the form of 'triples' (each atomic piece of data has three parts, namely a subject, predicate and object), and can be stored in a specialised [database](/glossary/en/terms/database/) called a [triple store](/glossary/en/terms/triple-store/).
