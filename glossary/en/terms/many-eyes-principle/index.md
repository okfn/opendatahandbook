If something is visible to many people then, collectively, they are more likely to find errors in it. Publishing open data can therefore be a way to improve its accuracy and [data quality](/glossary/en/terms/data-quality/), especially where a good interface for reporting errors is provided. See [crowdsourcing](/glossary/en/terms/crowdsourcing/).
