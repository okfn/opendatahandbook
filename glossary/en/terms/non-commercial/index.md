title: Non commercial
---

A restriction, as part of a [licence](/glossary/en/terms/licence/), that content cannot be freely re-used for 'commercial' purposes. Content or data subject to a non-commercial restriction is not open, according to the [Open Definition](/glossary/en/terms/open-definition/). Such a restriction reduces economic value and causes problems with [licence mixing](/glossary/en/terms/licence-mixing/), as well as often ruling out more than is intended (for example, it is often unclear whether educational uses are 'commercial'). The intent of a non-commercial clause may be better captured by a [share-alike](/glossary/en/terms/share-alike-license/) requirement.
