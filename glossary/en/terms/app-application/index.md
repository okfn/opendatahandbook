A piece of software (short for 'application'), especially one designed to run on the [web](/glossary/en/terms/web/) or on mobile phones and similar platforms. Apps can make network connections to large databases and thus be a powerful way of {consuming} open data, which may be {real-time}, personalised, and (using a mobile phone's [GPS](/glossary/en/terms/gps/)) location-specific information. [Crowdsourcing](/glossary/en/terms/crowdsourcing/) apps can also be used to build or improve datasets.
