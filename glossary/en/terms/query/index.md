title: Query
---

A type of question accepted by a [database](/glossary/en/terms/database/) about the data it holds. A complex query may ask the database to select records according to some criteria, aggregate certain quantities across those records, etc. Many databases accept queries in the specialised language SQL or dialects of it. A web [API](/glossary/en/terms/api/) allows an [app](/glossary/en/terms/app-application) to send queries to a database over the [web](/glossary/en/terms/web/). Compared with downloading and processing the data, this reduces both the computation load on the app and the [bandwidth](/glossary/en/terms/bandwidth) needed.
