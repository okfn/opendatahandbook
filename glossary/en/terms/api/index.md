Application Programming Interface. For data, this is usually a way provided by the data [publisher](/glossary/en/terms/publisher/) for programs or [apps](/glossary/en/term/app-application) to read data directly over the [web](/glossary/en/terms/web/). The app sends the API a [query](/glossary/en/terms/query/) asking for the specific data it needs, e.g. the time of the next bus leaving a particular stop. This allows the app to use the data without downloading the whole dataset, saving [bandwidth](/glossary/en/terms/bandwidth) and ensuring that the data used is the most up-to-date available.
