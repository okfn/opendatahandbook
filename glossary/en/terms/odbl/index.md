Open Database Licence, an attempt to create an open licence for data which covers the 'database right' (see [copyright](/glossary/en/terms/copyright/)) as well as copyright itself. It does this by imposing contractual obligations on the data [re-user](/glossary/en/terms/re-use). Unfortunately contract law is fundamentally different from copyright law, since copyright is inherent in a work and binds all downstream users of the work, whereas a contract only binds the parties to the contract and has no force on a later re-user of re-published data. The ODbL remains useful nevertheless, and other attempts are being made to create open licences specifically for data.
