Data in a format that can be conveniently read by a human. Some human-readable formats, such as [PDF](/glossary/en/terms/pdf/), are not [machine-readable](/glossary/en/terms/machine-readable) as they are not structured data, i.e. the representation of the data on disk does not represent the actual relationships present in the data.
