title: Shapefile
---

A popular [file format](/glossary/en/terms/file-format/) for [geodata](/glossary/en/terms/geodata/), maintained and published by Esri, a manufacturer of [GIS](/glossary/en/terms/gis/) software. A Shapefile actually consists of several related files. Though the format is technically [proprietary](/glossary/en/terms/proprietary/), Esri publish a full specification [standard](/glossary/en/terms/standard/) and Shapefiles can be read by a wide range of software, so function somewhat like an open standard in practice.
