title: Shapefile
---

A popular [file format](../file-format/) for [geodata](../geodata/), maintained and published by Esri, a manufacturer of [GIS](../gis/) software. A Shapefile actually consists of several related files. Though the format is technically [proprietary](../proprietary/), Esri publish a full specification [standard](../standard/) and Shapefiles can be read by a wide range of software, so function somewhat like an open standard in practice.
