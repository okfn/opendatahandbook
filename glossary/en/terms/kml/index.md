Keyhole Markup Language, an [XML](/glossary/en/terms/xml/)-based [open format](/glossary/en/terms/open-format/) for [geodata](/glossary/en/terms/geodata/). KML was devised for Keyhole Earth Viewer, later acquired by Google and renamed Google Earth, but has been an international [standard](/glossary/en/terms/standard/) of the Open Geospatial Consortium since 2008.
