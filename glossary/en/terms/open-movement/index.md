title: Open movement
---

The open movement seeks to work towards solutions of many of the world's most pressing problems in a spirit of transparency, collaboration, re-use and free access. It encompasses [open data](../open-data/), [open government](../open-government/), [open development](../open-development/), [open science](../open-science/) and much more. Participatory processes, sharing of knowledge and outputs and [open source](../open-source/) software are among its key tools. The specific definition of “open” as applied to data, knowledge and content, is set out by the [Open Definition](../open-definition/).
