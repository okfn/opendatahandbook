title: Anonymisation
---

Processing data that includes personal information so that individuals can no longer be identified in the resulting data. Anonymisation enables data to be published without breaching [data protection](../data-protection-legislation/) principles. The principal techniques are aggregation and [de-identification](../de-identification/). Care must be taken to avoid [data leakage](../data-leakage/) that would result in individuals' privacy being compromised. UKAN studies best practice in data anonymisation.
