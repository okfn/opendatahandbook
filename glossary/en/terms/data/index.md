Data may be thought of as unprocessed atomic statements of fact. It very often refers to systematic collections of numerical information in tables of numbers such as [spreadsheets](/glossary/en/terms/spreadsheet) or [databases](/glossary/en/terms/database). When data is structured and presented so as to be useful and relevant for a particular purpose, it becomes [information](/glossary/en/terms/information/) available for human apprehension. See also [knowledge](/glossary/en/terms/knowledge/).
