Application Programming Interface. For data, this is usually a way provided by the data [publisher](/glossary/en/terms/publisher/) for programs or {apps} to read data directly over the [web](/glossary/en/terms/web/). The app sends the API a [query](/glossary/en/terms/query/) asking for the specific data it needs, e.g. the time of the next bus leaving a particular stop. This allows the app to use the data without downloading the whole dataset, saving {bandwidth} and ensuring that the data used is the most up-to-date available.
