title: Transport data
---

Public transport routes, timetables and [real time](/glossary/en/terms/real-time/) data are valuable but difficult candidates for open data. Even when they are published, data from different transit authorities and companies may not be available in compatible formats, making it difficult for third parties to provide integrated transport information. Work on {standardisation} and more open data is ongoing in the sector.
