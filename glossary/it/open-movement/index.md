---

The open movement seeks to work towards solutions of many of the world's most pressing problems in a spirit of transparency, collaboration, re-use and free access. It encompasses [open data](/glossary/en/terms/open-data/), [open government](/glossary/en/terms/open-government/), [open development](/glossary/en/terms/open-development/), [open science](/glossary/en/terms/open-science/) and much more. Participatory processes, sharing of knowledge and outputs and [open source](/glossary/en/terms/open-source/) software are among its key tools. The specific definition of “open” as applied to data, knowledge and content, is set out by the [Open Definition](/glossary/en/terms/open-definition/).
