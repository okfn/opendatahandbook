A published specification for, e.g., the structure of a particular [file format](/glossary/en/terms/file-format/), recommended nomenclature to use in a particular domain, a common set of [metadata](/glossary/en/terms/metadata/) fields, etc. Conforming to relevant standards greatly increases the value of published data by improving machine readability and easing [data integration](/glossary/en/terms/data-integration/).
