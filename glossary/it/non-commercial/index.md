title: Non commercial

A restriction, as part of a [licence](/glossary/en/terms/licence/), that content cannot be freely {re-used} for 'commercial' purposes. Content or data subject to a non-commercial restriction is not open, according to the [Open Definition](/glossary/en/terms/open-definition/). Such a restriction reduces {economic value} and causes problems with {licence mixing}, as well as often ruling out more than is intended (for example, it is often unclear whether educational uses are 'commercial'). The intent of a non-commercial clause may be better captured by a {share-alike} requirement.
