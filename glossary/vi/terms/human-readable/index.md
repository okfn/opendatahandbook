title: Human Readable
---

Data in a format that can be conveniently read by a human. Some human-readable formats, such as [PDF](../pdf/), are not [machine-readable](../machine-readable/) as they are not [structured data](../structured-data/), i.e. the representation of the data on disk does not represent the actual relationships present in the data.
