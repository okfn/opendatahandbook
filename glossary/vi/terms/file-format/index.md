title: File format
---

The description of how a file is represented on a computer disk. The format usually corresponds to the last part of the file name ('extension'), e.g. a file in [CSV](../csv/) format might be called schools-list.csv. The file format refers to the internal format of the file, not how it is displayed to users. E.g. CSV and [XLS](../xls/) files are structured very differently on disk, but may look similar or identical when opened in a [spreadsheet](../spreadsheet/) program such as Excel.
