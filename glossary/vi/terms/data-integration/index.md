title: Data integration
---

Almost any interesting use of data will combine data from different sources. To do this it is necessary to ensure that the different datasets are compatible: they must use the same names for the same objects, the same units or co-ordinates, etc. If the [data quality](../data-quality/) is good this process of data integration may be straightforward but if not it is likely to be arduous. A key aim of [linked data](../linked-data/) is to make data integration fully or nearly fully automatic. Non-open data is a barrier to data integration, as obtaining the data and establishing the necessary permission to use it is time-consuming and must be done afresh for each dataset.
