title: Unique identifier
---

(or UID): An [identifier](../identifier/) for an object which is guaranteed to be different from identifiers of all other objects in a collection. Within a database, every object will have a UID that is unique within the database. A UID assigned by a central registry (such as an ISBN for books, or a [DOI](../doi/) for data) will be unique for all objects for which it is assigned. The http://... identifiers of [linked data](../linked-data/) provide a technique for guaranteeing UIDs without a central authority.
