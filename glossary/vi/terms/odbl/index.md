title: ODbL

Open Database Licence, an attempt to create an open licence for data which covers the '[database rights](../database-rights/)' (see [copyright](../copyright/)) as well as copyright itself. It does this by imposing contractual obligations on the data [re-user](../re-use/). Unfortunately contract law is fundamentally different from copyright law, since copyright is inherent in a work and binds all downstream users of the work, whereas a contract only binds the parties to the contract and has no force on a later re-user of re-published data. The ODbL remains useful nevertheless, and other attempts are being made to create open licences specifically for data.
