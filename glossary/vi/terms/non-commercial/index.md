title: Non commercial
---

A restriction, as part of a [licence](../licence/), that content cannot be freely re-used for 'commercial' purposes. Content or data subject to a non-commercial restriction is not open, according to the [Open Definition](../open-definition/). Such a restriction reduces economic value and causes problems with [licence mixing](../licence-mixing/), as well as often ruling out more than is intended (for example, it is often unclear whether educational uses are 'commercial'). The intent of a non-commercial clause may be better captured by a [share-alike](../share-alike-license/) requirement.
