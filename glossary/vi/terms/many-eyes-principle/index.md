title: Many eyes principle

If something is visible to many people then, collectively, they are more likely to find errors in it. Publishing open data can therefore be a way to improve its accuracy and [data quality](../data-quality/), especially where a good interface for reporting errors is provided. See [crowdsourcing](../crowdsourcing/).
