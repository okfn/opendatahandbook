Processing a dataset to make it easier to consume. This may involve fixing inconsistencies and errors, removing non-machine-readable elements such as formatting, using standard labels for row and column headings, ensuring that numbers, dates, and other quantities are represented appropriately, [conversion](../conversion/) to a suitable [file format](../file-format/), reconciliation of labels with another dataset being used (see [data integration](../data-integration/)), etc. See [data quality](../data-quality/).
