title: Data portal
---

A [web](../web/) platform for publishing data. The aim of a data portal is to provide a data catalogue, making data not only available but [discoverable](../discoverable/) for data users, while offering a convenient publishing workflow for publishing organisations. Typical features are web interfaces for publishing and for searching and browsing the catalogue, machine interfaces (APIs) to enable automatic publishing from other systems, and data preview and visualisation.
