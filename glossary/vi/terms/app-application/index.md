title: App / Application
---

A piece of software (short for 'application'), especially one designed to run on the [web](../web/) or on mobile phones and similar platforms. Apps can make network connections to large databases and thus be a powerful way of consuming open data, which may be real-time, personalised, and (using a mobile phone's [GPS](../gps/)) location-specific information. [Crowdsourcing](../crowdsourcing/) apps can also be used to build or improve datasets.
