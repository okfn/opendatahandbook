To score the maximum five stars, data must (1) be available on the Web under an open [licence](../licence/), (2) be in the form of [structured data](../structured-data/), (3) be in a non-proprietary file format, (4) use URIs as its [identifiers](../identifier/) (see also [RDF](../rdf/)), (5) include links to other data sources (see [linked data](../linked-data/)). To score 3 stars, it must satisfy all of (1)-(3), etc.
