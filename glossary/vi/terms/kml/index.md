Keyhole Markup Language, an [XML](../xml/)-based [open format](../open-format/) for [geodata](../geodata/). KML was devised for Keyhole Earth Viewer, later acquired by Google and renamed Google Earth, but has been an international [standard](../standard/) of the Open Geospatial Consortium since 2008.
