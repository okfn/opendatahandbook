Resource Description Framework, the native way of describing [linked data](../linked-data/). RDF is not exactly a data format; rather, there are a few equivalent formats in which RDF can be expressed, including an [XML](../xml/)-based format. RDF data takes the form of 'triples' (each atomic piece of data has three parts, namely a subject, predicate and object), and can be stored in a specialised [database](../database/) called a [triple store](../triple-store/).
