title: Government data
---

The work of government involves collecting huge amounts of data, much of which is not confidential (economic data, demographic data, spending data, crime data, transport data, etc). The value of much of this data can be greatly enhanced by releasing it as open data, freeing it for [re-use](../re-use/) by business, research, civil society, data journalists, etc.
