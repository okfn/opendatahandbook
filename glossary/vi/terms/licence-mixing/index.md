title: Licence mixing 
---

If Project X publishes content, and wants to include content from Project Y, it is necessary that Y's [licence](../licence/) permits at least the same range of [re-uses](../re-use/) as X's licence. For example, content published under a [non-commercial](../non-commercial/) licence cannot be included in Wikipedia, since Wikipedia's open licence includes rights for commercial re-use which cannot be granted for the non-commercial data, an example of a failure of licences to mix well.
