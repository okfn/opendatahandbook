title: Linked data
---

A form of data representation where every [identifier](../identifier/) is an http://... URI, using standard lists (see [vocabulary](../vocabulary/)) of identifiers where possible, and where datasets include links to reference datasets of the same objects. A key aim is to make [data integration](../data-integration/) automatic, even for large datasets. Linked data is usually represented using [RDF](../rdf/). See also [five stars of open data](../five-stars-of-open-data/); [triple store](../triple-store/).
