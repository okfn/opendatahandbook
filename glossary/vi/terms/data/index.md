Data may be thought of as unprocessed atomic statements of fact. It very often refers to systematic collections of numerical information in tables of numbers such as [spreadsheets](../spreadsheet/) or [databases](../database/). When data is structured and presented so as to be useful and relevant for a particular purpose, it becomes [information](../information/) available for human apprehension. See also [knowledge](../knowledge/).
