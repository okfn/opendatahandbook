title: Structured data
---

All data has some structure, but 'structured data' refers to data where the structural relation between elements is explicit in the way the data is stored on a computer disk. [XML](../xml/) and [JSON](../json/) are common formats that allow many types of structure to be represented. The internal representation of, for example, word-processing documents or [PDF](../pdf/) documents reflects the positioning of entities on the page, not their logical structure, which is correspondingly difficult or impossible to extract automatically.
