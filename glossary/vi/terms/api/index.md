Application Programming Interface. For data, this is usually a way provided by the data [publisher](../publisher/) for programs or [apps](../app-application/) to read data directly over the [web](../web/). The app sends the API a [query](../query/) asking for the specific data it needs, e.g. the time of the next bus leaving a particular stop. This allows the app to use the data without downloading the whole dataset, saving [bandwidth](../bandwidth/) and ensuring that the data used is the most up-to-date available.
