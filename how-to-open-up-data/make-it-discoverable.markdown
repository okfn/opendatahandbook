# Make data discoverable

:term:\`Open data\` is nothing without users. You need to be able to make sure
that people can find the source material. This section will cover different
approaches.

The most important thing is to provide a neutral space which can overcome both
inter-agency politics and future budget cycles.  Jurisdictional borders,
whether sectorial or geographical, can make cooperation difficult. However,
there are significant benefits in joining forces. The easier it is for
outsiders to discover data, the faster new and useful tools will be built.

## Existing tools

There are a number of tools which are live on the web that are specifically
designed to make data more discoverable.

One of the most prominent is the [DataHub](http://thedatahub.org/) and is
a catalog and data store for datasets from around the world. The site makes it
easy for individuals and organizations to publish material and for data users
to find material they need.

In addition, there are dozens of specialist catalogs for different sectors and
places. Many scientific communities have created a catalog system for their
fields, as data are often required for publication.

## For government

As it has emerged, orthodox practice is for a lead agency to create a catalog
for the government's data. When establishing a catalog, try to create some
  structure which allows many departments to easily keep their own information
  current.

Resist the urge to build the software to support the catalog from scratch.
There are free and open source software solutions (such as
[CKAN](http://ckan.org/)) which have been adopted by many governments already.
As such, investing in another platform may not be needed.

There are a few things that most open data catalogs miss. Your programme could
consider the following:

-   Providing an avenue to allow the private and community sectors to add their
    data. It may be worthwhile to think of the catalog as the region's catalog,
    rather than the regional government's.
-   Facilitating improvement of the data by allowing derivatives of datasets to
    be cataloged. For example, someone may geocode addresses and may wish to
    share those results with everybody. If you only allow single versions of
    datasets, these improvements remain hidden.
-   Be tolerant of your data appearing elsewhere. That is, content is likely to
    be duplicated to communities of interest. If you have river level
    monitoring data available, then your data may appear in a catalog for
    hydrologists.
-   Ensure that access is equitable. Try to avoid creating a privileged level
    of access for officials or tenured researchers as this will undermine
    community participation and engagement.

## For civil society

Be willing to create a supplementary catalog for non-official data.

It is very rare for governments to associate with unofficial or
non-authoritative sources. Officials have often gone to great expense to ensure
that there will not be political embarrassment or other harm caused from misuse
or overreliance on data.

Moreover, governments are unlikely to be willing to support activities that
mesh their information with information from businesses.  Governments are
rightfully skeptical of profit motives. Therefore, an independent catalog for
community groups, businesses and others may be warranted.
