# Apply an Open License (Legal Openness)

In most jurisdictions there are intellectual property rights in data that
prevent third-parties from using, reusing and redistributing data without
explicit permission. Even in places where the existence of rights is uncertain,
it is important to apply a license simply for the sake of clarity. Thus, **if
you are planning to make your data available you should put a license on it**
â€“ and if you want your data to be [open](http://opendefinition.org/) this is
even more important.

What licenses can you use? We recommend that for 'open' data you use one of the
licenses conformant with the [Open Definition](open_) and marked as suitable
for data. This list (along with instructions for usage) can be found at:

A short 1-page instruction guide to applying an open data license can be found
on the Open Data Commons site:
