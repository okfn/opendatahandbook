# How to Open up Data

This section forms the core of this handbook. It gives concrete, detailed
advice on how data holders can open up data. We’ll go through the basics, but
also cover the pitfalls. Lastly, we will discuss the more subtle issues that
can arise.

There are three key rules we recommend following when opening up data:

-   **Keep it simple.** Start out small, simple and fast. There is no
    requirement that every dataset must be made open right now. Starting out by
    opening up just one dataset, or even one part of a large dataset, is fine
    -- of course, the more datasets you can open up the better.

    Remember this is about innovation. Moving as rapidly as possible is good
    because it means you can build momentum and learn from experience --
    innovation is as much about failure as success and not every dataset will
    be useful.

-   **Engage early and engage often.** Engage with actual and potential users
    and re-users of the data as early and as often as you can, be they
    citizens, businesses or developers. This will ensure that the next
    iteration of your service is as relevant as it can be.

    It is essential to bear in mind that much of the data will not reach
    ultimate users directly, but rather via ‘info-mediaries’. These are the
    people who take the data and transform or remix it to be presented. For
    example, most of us don’t want or need a large database of GPS coordinates,
    we would much prefer a map. Thus, engage with infomediaries first. They
    will re-use and repurpose the material.

-   **Address common fears and misunderstandings**. This is especially
    important if you are working with or within large institutions such as
    government. When opening up data you will encounter plenty of questions and
    fears. It is important to (a) identify the most important ones and (b)
    address them at as early a stage as possible.

There are four main steps in making data open, each of which will be covered in
detail below. These are in very approximate order - many of the steps can be
done simultaneously.

1.  **Choose your dataset(s).** Choose the dataset(s) you plan to make open.
    Keep in mind that you can (and may need to) return to this step if you
    encounter problems at a later stage.
2.  **Apply an open license.**

    > 1.  Determine what intellectual property rights exist in the data.
    > 2.  Apply a suitable ‘open’ license that licenses all of these rights and
    >     supports the definition of openness discussed in the section above on
    >     ‘What Open Data’
    > 3.  NB: if you can't do this go back to step 1 and try a different
    >     dataset.

3.  **Make the data available** - in bulk and in a useful format. You may also
    wish to consider alternative ways of making it available such as via an
    API.
4.  **Make it discoverable** - post on the web and perhaps organize a central
    catalog to list your open datasets.
