###Open data can provide an incentive for quality and performance improvements in education by revealing patterns of sliding test scores. Shule.info is a website set up in Tanzania to allow users to examine school performance, compare exam results (by region, or over time), and evaluate the impact of a huge drop in pass rates in 2012. Those schools performing well can be identified to set the benchmark for best practice in the country. Conversely, those institutions that are under-performing can be more easily identified and targeted with support and interventions. [Parents may also be more selective in their choice of schools](http://education.okfn.org/open-education-tanzania/).
